	abstract = {Using the method or time-delayed embedding, a signal can be embedded into higher-dimensional space in order to study its dynamics. This requires knowledge of two parameters: The delay parameter τ , and the embedding dimension parameter D. Two standard methods to estimate these parameters in one-dimensional time series involve the inspection of the Average Mutual Information ({AMI}) function and the False Nearest Neighbor ({FNN}) function. In some contexts, however, such as phase-space reconstruction for Multidimensional Recurrence Quantiﬁcation Analysis ({MdRQA}), the empirical time series that need to be embedded already possess a dimensionality higher than one. In the current article, we present extensions of the {AMI} and {FNN} functions for higher dimensional time series and their application to data from the Lorenz system coded in Matlab.},
